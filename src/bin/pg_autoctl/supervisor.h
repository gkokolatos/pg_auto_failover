 * Supervisor restart strategy.
 *
 * The idea is to restart processes that have failed, so that we can stay
 * available without external intervention. Sometimes though if the
 * configuration is wrong or the data directory damaged beyond repair or for
 * some reasons, the service can't be restarted.
 *
 * This strategy is inspired by http://erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html and
 * http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html#maximum-restart-intensity
 *
 *    If more than MaxR number of restarts occur in the last MaxT seconds, the
 *    supervisor terminates all the child processes and then itself. The
 *    termination reason for the supervisor itself in that case will be
 *    shutdown.
 *
 * SUPERVISOR_SERVICE_MAX_RETRY is MaxR, SUPERVISOR_SERVICE_MAX_TIME is MaxT.

 *
 * With an array of SUPERVISOR_SERVICE_MAX_RETRY we can track this amount of
 * retries and compare the oldest one with the current time to decide if we are
 * allowed to restart or now, applying MaxT.

/*
 * The supervisor works with an array of Service entries. Each service defines
 * its behavior thanks to a start function, a stop function, and a reload
 * function. Those are called at different points to adjust to the situation as
 * seen by the supervisor.
 *
 * In particular, services may be started more than once when they fail.
 *
 * A supervisor can also work with an array of "dynamic services". Those differ
 * from the array described above as they can be added or removed at any point.
 * Even if a dynamic service has been added during start up, it will be started
 * after the static services have been started succefully.
 * Another difference is when a dynanic service has exhausted it's restart
 * attempts, the supervisor will choose to stop this particular service instead
 * of shutting down.
 *
 * What differenciates the two different kinds of services, is their location in
 * the supervisor struct. They look indentical otherwise.
